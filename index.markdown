I'm an experimental physicist in quantum optics and nanophotonics. 
I'm currently a postdoc in Alp Sipahigil's [Quantum Devices group](https://quantumdevices.berkeley.edu/) at [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). 
I enjoy building and learning about quantum systems, as well as the technology that goes into them. My research direction is to explore ways to interface different platforms, in particular atoms and photons, to enable new capabilities and perform bigger tasks
in quantum information processing.

I have been very fortunate to collaborate with teams of talented scientists.  Before joining Berkeley, I did my PhD work in [Misha Lukin's group](https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard Physics](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/) 
and my undergraduate studies at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/), where I worked in the groups of [Vladan Vuletic](https://www.rle.mit.edu/eapg/) and [Leonid Levitov](http://www.mit.edu/~levitov/).
