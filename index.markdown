I am an experimental physicist who enjoys learning and making discoveries about the science and engineering that go into building quantum devices. My goal is to explore ways to interface different quantum systems to perform bigger tasks and to enable new capabilities.

 <!-- that take advantage of quantum physics, from computers to sensors.  -->

<!-- Given the recent technological advances that make it possible to put quantum systems of tens to hundreds of qubits under control, the demand to connect and interface quantum systems is imminent.  -->

I have been very fornutate to collaborate with many talented scientists. I currently work as a postdoc at [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) in [Alp Sipahigil's group](https://quantumdevices.berkeley.edu/). Prior to Berkeley, I completed my PhD in [Misha Lukin's group](https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard Physics](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/) and my undergraduate degree at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/).
