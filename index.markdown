I'm an experimental physicist and engineer with a background in photonics, quantum optics, and systems engineering. My work bridges fundamental research and practical technology, from building quantum optics experiments to developing a sensing device platform.

My previous research in quantum optics broadly falls under the theme of photonic integration of quantum systems. This includes integrating color centers with silicon photonics during my postdoc in Alp Sipahigil's [Quantum Devices group](https://quantumdevices.berkeley.edu/) at Berkeley EECS, and coupling cold atoms in optical tweezers to photonic crystal cavities during my PhD in [Misha Lukin's group](https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. As an undergraduate at MIT, I worked on atomic physics and condensed matter theory in the groups of [Vladan Vuletic](https://www.rle.mit.edu/eapg/) and [Leonid Levitov](http://www.mit.edu/~levitov/). 

Currently, I'm at Apple developing a sensing device platform based on photonic integrated circuits.
