Hi, I'm Po Samutpraphoot. I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Alp Sipahigil's [Quantum Devices group](https://quantumdevices.berkeley.edu/) at [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). I enjoy learning about quantum systems and the technology that goes into engineering them. In my research, I explore ways to interface different platforms, from atoms to photonics, to enable new capabilities and perform bigger tasks.


I have been very fortunate to collaborate with many talented scientists.  Prior to joining Berkeley, I did my PhD work in [Misha Lukin's group](https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard Physics](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/) and my undergraduate studies at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/), where I worked with [Vladan Vuletic](https://www.rle.mit.edu/eapg/) and [Leonid Levitov](http://www.mit.edu/~levitov/).  

For more, please see my [CV](samutpraphoot_cv_2022.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TU4yHVYAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.
