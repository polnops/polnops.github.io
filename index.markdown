I am an experimental physicist in quantum optics and nanophotonics. My research direction is to explore ways to interface different platforms, in particular atoms and photons, to enable new capabilities and perform bigger tasks
in quantum information processing.

I have been very fortunate to collaborate with teams of talented scientists. I did my postdoc work in the [Quantum Devices group](https://quantumdevices.berkeley.edu/) at [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), my PhD in [Misha Lukin's group](https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard Physics](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/),
and my undergraduate studies at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/), where I worked in the groups of [Vladan Vuletic](https://www.rle.mit.edu/eapg/) and [Leonid Levitov](http://www.mit.edu/~levitov/).  

I am currently part of a team that develops a sensing device platform based on photonic integrated circuits at Apple Inc.
