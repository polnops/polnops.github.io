I am an experimental physicist who enjoys learning and making discoveries about the science and engineering that go into building quantum devices. 

 <!-- that take advantage of quantum physics, from computers to sensors.  -->

<!-- Given the recent technological advances that make it possible to put quantum systems of tens to hundreds of qubits under control, the demand to connect and interface quantum systems is imminent.  -->

I currently work as a postdoc at [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) in [Alp Sipahigil's group](https://quantumdevices.berkeley.edu/). 

Also see my [CV](samutpraphoot_cv_2021.pdf) and my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TU4yHVYAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.
