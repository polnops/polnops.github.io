### Interfacing atoms in optical tweezers with nanophotonics

Atoms in tweezer arrays have recently emerged as a leading platform for quantum simulation and information processing. 
These systems are growing more complex, and there is a demand for optical interfaces to enable efficient readout and better connectivity. 
We realized such interface using a nanophotonic cavity and demonstrated quantum control of two atoms strongly coupled to it. 
In the most recent work, we entangled two atoms via the cavity and "shipped" the entanglement away from the system.

### Valley transport in topological Dirac materials 

[<img src="/images/figintro.001.png" style="float: right; width: 45%;  margin-bottom: 0.25em;">](/images/figintro.001.png)

Conventional electronics relies on the manipulation of electrons as charge carriers. However, electrons in particular quantum materials can possess extra degrees of freedom such as spin or valley. We theoretically investigated valley transport phenomena arising from Berry curvature, a property associated with band topology in gapped Dirac materials such as graphene on hexagonal Boron Nitride (G/hBN).

### Narrow-linewidth lasers

Lasers are the workhorse of modern atomic physics. Recent advances, from optical trapping and cooling to quantum control of atomic states, are enabled by the linewidth improvements of semiconductor diode lasers. In this work, we narrowed the linewidth of UV diode lasers by orders of magnitude using optical feedback from a long fiber cavity.
